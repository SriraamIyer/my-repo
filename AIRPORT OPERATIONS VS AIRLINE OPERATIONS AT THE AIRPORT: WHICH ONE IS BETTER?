Most airports in India use airline services for their operations while some use their own services and are not dependent on the airlineâ€™s services.

Here are a few advantages of using the airport services over the airline services at the airport-
1. The airport staff can help you if you are flying by any airline, but that is not the case with airline staff at the airport, they will only help the passengers on the
airline they are flying by.
Bangalore Airport uses the airport staff system in which they have their own staff.
2. In the case of multi-terminal airports, if the distance between the terminals are more, a shuttle bus service is used. If the airport shuttle bus service is employed,
there will be no problem; however, the airline shuttle bus is not a viable alternative due to the possibility of the airline changing its terminals.

There are a few disadvantages of using the airport operations over the airline operations at the airport-
1. If there is an airline-related assistance needed, then the airline staff can be of better help.

Overall, I feel that airport operations should be used more than the airline operation as the airlines can change their terminals, services, etc.
