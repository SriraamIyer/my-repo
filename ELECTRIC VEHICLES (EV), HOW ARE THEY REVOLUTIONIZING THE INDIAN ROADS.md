India has now started revolutionizing Electric Vehicles from Petrol, diesel, and Compresses Natural Gas (CNG) to build a greener future, to reduce pollution. Except for these reasons,
there are a few other reasons why EVs are revolutionizing Indian roads. Since the EVs have come into play, be it scooter, bike, car, bus, etc. they all have been manufactured and made
in a different style compared to the conventional fuel and CNG vehicles.

Given below are some of the differences that have been seen in the EVs- 
1.	Many of the E-bikes donâ€™t have a double stand.
2.	All the E-bikes have a digital speedometer.
3.	Most of the bikes have some salient features like navigation, tire pressure monitor, and vehicle-related documents on the screen itself.
4.	Even cars, tempos, buses, and locomotive engines have been revolutionizing the EV industry.
5.	All the EV buses are all Air Conditioned (A/C)
6.	In the case of buses, not only the public buses but also the airline buses at the airport. Indigo (6E) is the first and only airline that has started with ground transportation
e buses to the flight from the terminal and vice versa. This is only in Mumbai (BOM) and Bangalore (BLR) airports.
And due to the public buses becoming EVs, some people have started preferring buses over other means of transport. Like in Mumbai, the old vintage double-decker buses were scrapped
and made way for the new A/C EV double-decker buses which exactly look like the buses of London.

There are a few points to be noted if one is going for Electric Vehicles-
1.	The EV industry is still not fully matured, which means that there is still not much charging infrastructure and facilities, mainly in apartments. So, one should consider
 before going for an EV as the batteries in most of the EV are in built and not detachable.
3.	There are charging stations being installed in public places, but they are all fast chargers, so they cannot be used for regular charging since it will affect the battery.
4.	If you are buying more than one EV, you need to think a lot before making that move, because once you buy any EV, the thumb rule is that you need to use it for daily use.
 If you are buying an EV scooter and an EV car, then you should only go for that move if you go to work far from your house and go to some classes or gym in your locality daily.
 (Minimum 5 days a week)
6.	In my case, I got an Ather e scooter home last month, nowadays I use the e-bike over my petrol car to go even for long distances. I only use the car to go somewhere if I have
 luggage. 
8.	The daily running should be a minimum of 2 km for scooters, 4 km for cars, and 6 km for buses.
9.	The price of EVs are always more expensive than fuel vehicles and their resale value is less as well. 

Overall, I feel that the EVs are revolutionizing the Indian roads big time, but still, they need to work on the infrastructure big time.
