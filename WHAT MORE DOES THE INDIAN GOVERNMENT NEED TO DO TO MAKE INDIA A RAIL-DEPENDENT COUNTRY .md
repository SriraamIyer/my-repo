WHAT MORE DOES INDIAN GOVERNMENT NEED TO DO TO MAKE INDIA RAIL-DEPENDENT 

There has been a huge revolution and development in the Indian railways taking place from the year of 2018. The coaches have been upgraded, speed has been increased, and new
trains have come, the introduction of Vande Bharat and Vande Sadharan express, etc. To promote train travel across India over the expensive road and air travel. 

In a few months, the Vande Metro services are going to be launched which will replace the existing Electronic Multiple Unit (EMU) trains, which run between two places that
are less than 100 km. There are even Vande Bharat sleeper trains going to be introduced for running long distances from the county capital Delhi to the state capitals and
replace the existing Rajdhani Express trains.

Despite these developments, the Indian government needs to plan on running the Vande Bharat Sleeper trains between the state capitals in the different parts of the country. If
they don’t do this, people will be still dependent on flights to travel between these kinds of places. It will be a good move according to me if they do this because already
some of the major short-distance domestic flight routes in India have started being non-profitable due to the introduction of Vande Bharat Express.

Below given are some of the routes on which the Vande Bharat Express can be run-
1.	Mumbai – Trivandrum
2.	Mumbai – Jaipur
3.	Madgaon – Trivandrum
4.  Mumbai  – Bhopal

There are a few disadvantages of using these trains over flights, some of them have been listed below- 
1.	These trains cannot be used in case of extreme emergency
2.  They can't be used if a passenger has more bags and luggage.
