Given below are few of the features which Ather has which other e scooters have not got-
1.	Ather has got a tow and theft detection system in its scooters, so if someone tries to run away with the scooter or tow it, it will alert you.
2.	Ather has got the fall safe feature, so when the scooter falls, the power is automatically cut to the scooter and it alerts the other vehicles.
3.

There are a few areas where Ather can still improve-
1.	Ather scooter prices are more as compared to the other e-scooter companies.
2.	The Ather is a bit stiff on their price, they try their best not to reduce their price, while the other e-scooters give discounts.
