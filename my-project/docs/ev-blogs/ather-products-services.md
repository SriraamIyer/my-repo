## Reasons why Ather is a successful e-scooter company, some of them are listed below
1.	Ather’s model of scooters make them attractive.
2.	Ather has a lot of features that the other e-scooters don’t have.
3.	Ather is the first e-scooter company that has public fast charging stations and neighbourhood charging stations.

## Few features which Ather has which other e scooters have not got
1.	Ather has got a tow and theft detection system in its scooters, so if someone tries to run away with the scooter or tow it, it will alert you.
2.	Ather has got the fall safe feature, so when the scooter falls, the power is automatically cut to the scooter and it alerts the other vehicles.

## Few accessories that Ather provides that no other e scooter provides

## Ather can still improve on
1.	Ather scooter prices are more as compared to the other e-scooter companies.
2.	The Ather is a bit stiff on their price, they try their best not to reduce their price, while the other e-scooters give discounts.
