## Some of the notable things about these airlines is that they share the ground services of Tata, as Tata is a very big industry. Here are some of the notable ground operations shared
1.	The stairway is used by Air India for both the airlines.
2.	The luggage vehicle is used by Air India as well for both the airlines.

## There are some areas where they can develop themselves more
