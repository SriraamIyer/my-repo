# How can smart luggage trolleys help passengers
Recently this month, Bangalore Airport (BLR) launched a new cabin bag trolley service in the airport Terminal 2 domestic departures. The trolleys are a smart trolley.

## The smart trolleys in BLR have some excellent features in them
1.	It displays a list of departing flights, their boarding and departure times, destination, and flight number. Once you select an airline from the list, it will show you the information about the airline's operating gate, distance, and navigation to the operating boarding gate. 
2.	If there is any gate change, it will alert you and help you navigate to the changed gate.
3.	This trolley is useful for the outlets as well, if you want to go to any eatery, lounge, or retail outlets, this will help you to navigate to the outlets where you want to go.

## There are still a few areas where they can use the smart trolley funda-
1.	They can implement this trolley as the luggage trolley so that it will help the passengers by guiding them to the entry gate and the check-in counter of their airline. It will help in guiding them to the outlets in the cityside and the check-in hall area of the airport.
2.	It will be a good idea to implement the same in the arrivals section as well, as they will help to go to the baggage claim of their airline and even guide them in assisting them to the private car pickup, cab pickup point, bus stand or the train station within the airport premises.
Overall, the smart trolley service is a great initiative by BLR, which helps passengers seamlessly. The same can be installed at the Terminal 2 international departures, Terminal 1, and the other airports as well. It is a useful trolley in large airports like Bangalore, Delhi, Chennai, and Mumbai. They can even implement the same for the luggage trolley.
