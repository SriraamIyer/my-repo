# INDIGO DOMESTIC OPERATIONS FROM MUMBAI TERMINAL 2

Recently, Indigo (6E) airlines placed an aircraft for 600 aircraft, due to which now there is a huge problem of infrastructure and parking space at the airports. Now due to this, Indigo started extending its domestic operations in some of the multi-terminal airports in India like Delhi (DEL) and Mumbai (BOM). In Delhi, they extended their operations to terminal 1, so in Delhi, Indigo operates its domestic flights from T1 and T2. In Mumbai, they operate their domestic flights from T1, they extended it to T2 in December 2023.
With Indigo extending its domestic operations to T2 in Mumbai, which is the international terminal, there are a few pros and cons.

## The following are the benefits of Indigo extending its domestic operations to Terminal 2 in Mumbai
1.	Extending their domestic operations in Mumbai T2 improves the airport experience of the passengers flying by Indigo as the T2 is overall larger, has better infrastructure, and has better options than the T1.
2.	If any transit passengers want to transit from domestic to international and vice versa, it will be easier for the passengers to transit as they do not need to change terminals, they can do the transit within the same terminal.

## There are a few cons of extending the operations to Terminal 2
1.	Indigo domestic flights operating at T2 in Mumbai will improve the airport experience for the Indigo passengers, but on the contrary, it will spoil the airport experience for the other airline passengers Air India (AI), and Air India Express (IX) which operate their domestic flights from T2 in Mumbai as Indigo becomes the only non-Tata airline to operate their domestic flights at T2 in Mumbai.
2.	If there is a domestic-to-domestic transit passenger of Indigo, he/she may find it difficult if their connecting flight is operating from Terminal 1 or vice versa.

Overall, Indigo has extended its domestic operations to T2 in Mumbai not to improve its airport experience, but to accommodate the space constraint to fit all their aircraft operating to and from Mumbai.
